			'A truly magical religious building in which 7 Serbian kings were crowned ranks high among the most influential Serbian monasteries. It is the endowment of Stefan Prvovencani, who was married there in 1217. Zica is located only 6 kilometers from the town of Kraljevo, in one of the most fruitful plains. Zica suffered several demolitions by Tatars, Turks, and Germans. It underwent its final renovation in 1987 when its original, medieval appearance was restored. It is known as the Church of the seven doors, as a new door was built each time a king was crowned in it. Once the king passed through the door after his coronation, the wall got bricked up. Apart from the coronation of the rulers, Zica was the place used as a headquarter by the patriarchs.',
